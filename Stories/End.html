	<h3>I quit</h3>

	<h4><a href="">MS</a><sub> - some Datetime</sub></h4>

	<p>I couldn't get that song out of my head. After my third coffee that morning, I caught myself typing to the rhythm of the vocals, and my desk neighbour gave me her "hey can you please lower the volume?" look at least twice. When I realized, after the second verse, that the politely pleading look had stopped working, I got up to go smoke, and convince myself to quit this job.</p>

<p>Outside, I rewound the song. < TODO: Write a description of the song. > Once I started audiating my own melody, in those tones, the argument was complete. I had to make this song.</p>

<p>When I came back inside, I got my boss' attention with the usual light knock on the edge of his desk, and was greeted with the usual "yo". This was a mediumish department, so a "we have to talk" wasn't exactly alarming, but it meant awkwardly pinging every meeting room and, this time, deciding to go for a walk instead. Walk talks tended to be more serious, or emotional, so I grabbed onto the foreshadowing given me by office overcrowding, and began with a loaded "so". Long story short, I said, we need to start a hiring process. He took it pretty well, since the last guy had only lasted 5 months, and I'd been able to put in 18. Over the course of the conversation, I myself became aware of how my coffee, nicotine, thc, and alcohol consumption had all increased since...</p>

<p>Well, since the rhino arrived. I finally told my boss about the rhino. He couldn't see it yet, but we had accidentally hired a rhino about 2 months earlier. We bought coffee, sat down, and I took some time to put my thoughts in order. Actually, that may have been when I started writing this. At any rate, based on conversations with other colleagues, I suspected that one or two others could also already see the rhino, but none of the leadership team had noticed him yet. They were all, for now, very happy with the rhino. I finally asked my boss whether he'd read Ionescu and, when he said no, I wished him luck and formally quit.</p>

<p>The next two weeks were pretty easy. My ex-boss asked for recommendations, and I called a few people I'd gone to school with. Out of the seven, three weren't currently into in web programming, but we had a quick chat with the rest and booked two interviews for the next day, then hired someone by Friday. Since my old team dealt with some pretty sensitive medical data, I still had to come in to the office to help the new dev learn the ropes, but anyway we hadn't seen each other in a long time, and it was great to hang out. After about four nights of dinner, drinks, and deep dives into the code, I felt that my former stake was in good hands, and handed off my auth credentials. And just like that, I became a musician.</p>

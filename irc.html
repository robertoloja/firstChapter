				<IrcMessage author="WH">I was just like d-_-b</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">lol</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">how u make that inverted b?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">wait..  nvm...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Hi. Please pardon my lateness, I was occupied.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">heyy</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Yo</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">No worries</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">lol u were right about pm</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Right about what?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">I mentioned you write pretty formally online</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">they told me u always talk like ur at work</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Well, communication is a muscle, and I take every opportunity to exercise it.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">I kind of agree with that</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">i like the way PM talks :smile:</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">...how do i use emojis in this??</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">;)</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">You have to write it out like this >:(</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">ooooooh</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">that angry face is cute lol</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Yes it is</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">But why are we using this platform? This seems ancient.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">It kind of is. 
				<a class="tooltip"
					onclick="showFootnote.call(this, event, 'irc')"
					onmouseover="showFootnote.call(this, event, 'irc')"
					onmouseout="showFootnote.call(this, event, 'irc')">IRC</a>
					is pretty old, but it's reliable. With software, old and boring is usually better</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">and i own this server</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Ah, right. That's my next question. Who are you, exactly?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">/me is WH ;)</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">WH is a friend I've known for a long time, who I trust to setup a secure server</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">How secure? And can someone please explain what we're here to talk about?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Pretty secure. It doesn't even keep any chat logs. Once we all disconnect, if we each erase our local copies, there won't be any records</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">and all connections are encrypted</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">JD? What do you think about this?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">it's ok, i think</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">WH really knows a lot about this stuff</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">dam rite I do</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">cyber security made me a looot of money lol</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">And who is "@bot"?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">my bot lol</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">ohoh it does tricks and stuff. like, runs little games</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">!help</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="bot">/me has avialable commands:<br>
					!help - this message<br>
					!hangman - play hangman<br>
					!dungeon - enter the dungeon<br>
					!sim - launch bridge sim<br>
					!admin - server stuff</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Dungeon? Bridge sim?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">They're games. Bridge sim takes the people in this channel and turns us into characters controlling a ship in space</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">oooh that sounds cooool</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">its fun we should play some time</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Pretty cool actually </IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">I haven't played dungeon. What is it?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">i dont really use it anymore. it's like a d&d/mud sort of thing</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Okay, I get it, the bot is for games. Sorry I brought it up. Why are we here?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">ok so i asked MS for help with our data thing</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">The missing data? So there's no solution?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">oh theres a solution alright lol</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Wait, how much does WH know about this? Who even is this guy??</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">whoooa way to assume gender...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">We explained enough to get an opinion. That's why we're here</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">JD?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">we kind of already talked about it a little..</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">it makes sense to me</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Okay... so what's the opinion?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">yall gotta do a data heist</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">I don't know what that means.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">we need to take the data from the ministry</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Take? What does "take" mean?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">like.. break in and take it</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">The last option is to make a copy from the source</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Isn't that what we tried already?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">nono we tried getting it from the API</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">I thought the API was the server?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">it is... wait.. isn't it?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">The API is the external interface to the server. Somewhere, there's a physical computer that's actually running the code that serves the API</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">oh it's not a vm? like there's actually a server?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">yeah there not running it off a cloud</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">theres good data privacy reasons to run ur own server</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">especaiilly if ur the government lol</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Wait, let me get this straight.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">You all think that the best option left is to steal medical records from the provincial government?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">yuup</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">it sounds kinda bad when u put it that way...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">I don't really think there's another option</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">This isn't an option... It's a crime.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">ummmm technically, no</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Pardon me?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">yeh ur pardoned</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">but its not a crime</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">The key thing is that, actually, you guys are supposed to have access to this data</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">...by using the API. Right? There was that whole nightmare approval process to even get a key for the damn thing.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">naaah thats just access control</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">thats not actually the law</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Sorry, are you a lawyer?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">lol no</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">So what do you know about this? Why should we listen to you?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Actually, MS and JD, please explain why you're paying any attention to this? You know this is crazy, right?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">i don't think it's so bad... i don't know, we're supposed to have the data, and we're actually allowed to get it in several different ways</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">the only real problem with this is the breaking and entering, i think...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Oh, okay, so when you said "break in and take it", you really meant "break in".</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">This is bananas.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Look, this is different from a data theft because, once you have the data, there's no crime to uncover. You're allowed to have it, you're supposed to have it. A criminal would be taking that data to sell it or something, or use it for blackmail or to steal identities. We're taking it to use it the way it's supposed to be used.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">We're just... taking it the wrong way</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Why would this involve breaking and entering, I don't understand.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">theres no easy way in over the network</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">i already scanned the shit out of that server</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">but knowing the provincial government i bet their physical security is crap compared to their cyber security</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">do we know where the server actually is??</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">;)</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">That's not too hard to figure out. It just takes some footwork.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Footwork?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Yeah, like, gumshoe stuff. Walking around, measuring stuff.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Measuring what?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">were gonna track latency between hops on the connection to the server from different parts of the city</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">thatll let us map their network to torontos geography and we should be able to deduce where the server is housed</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Is it possible to explain that in English?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">i just did...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Think of it kind of like sonar</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">If we know how long a message takes to go to and from the server, depending on where we are in the city, we'll get an approximation of how far the server physically is from each location where we measure the latency</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Oh, okay, and then we can break in to that building.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">yeh u got it</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Yeah, this is insane. You've all gone insane.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">What if you get caught?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">lol</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">i don't think we'd get caught...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">WH is really good at this. he was telling us stories</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">yeh were not gonna get caught</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">That isn't reassuring.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">it should be</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">i dont get caught</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Oh?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">ive been at this for almost a decade and ive never used a jail pass</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">What's a "jail pass"?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">it's like from monopoly, the get out of jail free card</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">I don't understand...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">WH is a pentester</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">among other things</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Like a hacker?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Yes, sort of</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">yes that is the correct word but ure using it wrong</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">How could you possibly tell that I've used it wrong?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">i can tell</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">It's not criminal. Like, organizations hire pentesters to break into their systems and write reports, so they can improve their security protocols</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">What kind of organizations?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Companies</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">governments, ngos...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">oh, wasn't there one that was a charity?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">yeh. also churches</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Churches need cybersecurity?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">everyone needs cybersecurity</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">What's a jail pass?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Usually, whoever hires the pentester will write a letter they can give to security, or to the cops, if the pentester gets caught</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">its a job</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">yeah like, nobody wants to go to jail for their job</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">And yet... here we are...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">i mean that's a good point...</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">nobodys going to jail</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">look this isnt magic. its an engineering problem</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">I really don't see how that could be true. How is this an engineering problem?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">its social engineering</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">we need to break down the problem into its smallest parts</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">then we can do research about each part</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">make a plan</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">and a schedule</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">like isnt there a deadline??</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">yeah we have 2 weeks</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">It isn't enough time for the kind of thing you're talking about.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">u dont know that</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">i say it is enough time</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">We... kind of already started</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">What does THAT mean?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">i already scanned the server</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">we said that already</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Umm</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Is that all?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">WH already started narrowing down the geographical search space</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">What?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">i have these raspberrypis setup in different spots all over the city</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">so i just wrote a script and sent it out to them to start recording latencies</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">that is so fucking cool</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Okay, when you said you started already, I assumed it meant doing something actively. You're just doing research so far?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Yeah yeah. There's a lot we can do without raising any flags as far as coming up with a plan</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">i mean none of it should raise any flags lol</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="MS">Right, yeah. Ideally, the plan goes off silently</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">Alright. Well, that's not so bad.</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="JD">right? yeah yeah i think so too</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="PM">What kind of a plan would it be?</IrcMessage>
				<IrcMessage author="WH">;)</IrcMessage>

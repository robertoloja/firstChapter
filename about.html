<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>
  <a href="index.html">
    <i>Poiesis: a pretension</i></a> is a 
  serialized
  work of <a href="hmm">digital fiction</a>,
  designed and written to be read on a desktop
  computer or mobile computing device. 
  The choice of medium is deliberate, since this
  work aims to comment on the culture that has
  developed around these devices, by using the tropes of that culture for dramatic effects. 
</p>

<p>
  Our story begins in the year 2020, when a losely
  connected group of acquaintances is forced to 
  confront a challenge that will see them
  acquire and use social engineering skills,
  perform missions, and, eventually... 
</p>

<p>
  The scope of the story increases over time. 
  For now, <a href="index.html">the introduction</a> is all that exists. But rest assured that, for
  us, "serialized" does not mean "meandering":

<p>
  A detailed, large-scale outline of this story
  already exists, continues constantly evolving,
  and has definitive plot endpoints. To prove this,
  and as an experiment, spoilers may be acquired 
  (at reader discretion) by 
  <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pretentiouspoiesis">joining our patreon</a>. All new
  chapters will always be published freely and
  open-source<sub><a href="#tech">2</a></sub>,
  but supporters will receive extra content,
  optional spoilers, and priviledged access to
  the authors.

  In a way, this is an old-fashioned website. It
  does not use UI frameworks, or even external
  dependencies. It does, however, make heavy use 
  of javascript, so it is possible that you arrived
  at this page because you have blocked or disabled
  web scripts.
  Allow us to set you at ease: at any point, any
  user can right click, inspect the source, and
  read exactly the javascript code that is running
  on this site.

<p>
  There's also a <a href="repo">public source code repository</a>, if you're into that sort of thing.

<h2>About</h2>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>
  <a href="index.html"><i>Poiesis: a pretension</i></a>
  is a serialized work of digital fiction. The story begins in 2020 Toronto,
  just as the lockdowns force our protagonists to adopt a fully online life.
  By navigating the apps used by the characters, readers uncover instant
  messages, emails, twitter threads, and group chat transcripts that unravel
  the story.
</p>

<p>
  The scope of this story increases over time. We begin in the present,
  diverging from real history via a massive cyberattack against the
  Tokyo Olympics (no, not 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Winter_Olympics_opening_ceremony#Hacking_of_computer_systems">that one</a>). For now, chapter 0: "introduction" is all that exists. But rest assured that, for us, "serialized" does not mean "meandering":
</p>

<p>
  <i>We <b>do not</b> believe in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/j_j_abrams_the_mystery_box/transcript?language=en"
    title="tl;dw: plot doesn't need an endpoint, just momentum">mystery box plots</a>.</i>
</p>

<p>
  A detailed, large-scale outline of this story
  already exists, continues constantly evolving,
  and has definitive plot endpoints. To prove this,
  and as an experiment, spoilers may be acquired 
  (at reader discretion) by 
  <a href="https://www.patreon.com/pretentiouspoiesis">joining our patreon</a>. All new
  chapters will always be published freely and
  open-source, but supporters will receive extra content,
  optional spoilers, and priviledged access to
  the authors. Alternatively, you can <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/poiesis">buy me a coffee</a>.
